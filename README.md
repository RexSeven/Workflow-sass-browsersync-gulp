# Matt's Workflow

## Project does the following:
Watches scss files in the sass directory and compiles them into css in the css directory 
Reloads changes live in the browser using browser sync

## Project commands:  
To set up the workflow cd into the project root directory and run the following command: 
```
nmp install
```  

If you don't have the gulp cli installed globaly you will also need to run this command:
```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Now everytime you wish to auto compile and reload your browser just run this command in the project root directory 
```
gulp
```
